    <!-- Influential Poetry -->
    </div>
        <div class="span-half">
         <p class="fine-print justify sans">"I have walked through many lives, some of them my own, and I am not who I was, though some principle of being abides, from which I struggle not to stray. When I look behind, as I am compelled to look before I can gather strength to proceed on my journey, I see the milestones dwindling toward the horizon and the slow fires trailing from the abandoned camp-sites, over which scavenger angels wheel on heavy wings. Oh, I have made myself a tribe out of my true affections, and my tribe is scattered!"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span-half">
            <p class="fine-print justify sans">"How shall the heart be reconciled to its feast of losses? In a rising wind the manic dust of my friends, those who fell along the way, bitterly stings my face. Yet I turn, I turn, exulting somewhat, with my will intact to go wherever I need to go, and every stone on the road precious to me. In my darkest night, when the moon was covered and I roamed through wreckage, a nimbus-clouded voice directed me: “Live in the layers, not on the litter.” Though I lack the art to decipher it, no doubt the next chapter in my book of transformations is already written. I am not done with my changes."</p>

The user interface is simple, ranging from document.ready functions already displaying APOD data, to requesting data with the click of a button. The site implements custom HTML and CSS to present an easy-to-use environment, with JavaScript operating as the muscle pulling the styling, structure, and vision together to create a functional Space Dash.</p>
